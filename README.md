# Fabrication Layout

This project was designed as an e-store for structural materials.

## Available Features

In this project, the user can select and add to cart needed products (based on type, material, size, etc.). Once in the cart, he then can see total costs plus costs of shipping and estimated time of arrival. Payment method is to be added, if the project will be of interest.

Besides shopping the products, one extra feature is that the user can calculate specific 3D geometrical shapes and intersections and translate these in 2D surfaces, very useful for calculating material bill (cost, weight, etc.).
Furthermore, i've added a DXF download feature for those geometries, so the user can simply enter on the app page, type input data, download the result file and use it for cutting or flattening, whatever suits better.

Every algorithm developed in this project is created by me, no API used, only trigonometric interpolation methods.
