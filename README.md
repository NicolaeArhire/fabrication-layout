# Fabrication Layout

This project was designed as an e-store for structural materials.

## Available Features

In this project, the user can select and add in the cart every product he wishes to accquire (based on type, material, size, etc.). Once in the cart, he then can see total costs plus costs of shipping and estimated time of arrival. Payment method is to be added in a later stage, if the project will be of interest.

Besides shopping the products, one extra feature is that the user can calculate 3D geometrical shapes and intersections and translate these in 2D surfaces, very useful for calculating material bill (cost, weight, etc.).
Furthermore, i've added a DXF download feature for those geometries, so the user can simply enter on the app page, type input data, download the result file and use it for cutting or flattening, whatever suits better.

Every algorithm developed in this project is created by me, no API used (is there any for this stuff?!), only pure trigonometric and numerical methods.
